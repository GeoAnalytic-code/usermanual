== The Map View
anchor:mapview[]

The map view is the central view of the application. It can be used to view the current GPS position overlaid on maps and vector datasets.

The map engine comes from the http://code.google.com/p/mapsforge/[mapsforge] project.

The <<supported_datasets,supported datasets>> section lists and describes all supported map types. Just to cite a few, one can view:

* http://www.openstreetmap.org/[OpenStreetMap] raster tile maps both when on-line (downloading new tiles) and off-line (visualizing those that were cached during online mode)
* http://www.mapbox.com/developers/mbtiles/[mbtiles databases]
* local and remote http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Tile_Map_Service_Specification[TMS] tiles
* mapsforge vector files


=== Map View tools

The Map View has a set of tools that can be used to interact with the map. 

When first launched, the tools are already visible on the map. To have a cleaner Map View, the user can long-tap on the upper right menu button to toggle the visibility of the tools.

Available tools are:

* Left screen side

  - add note (the same that is accessed from the dashboard) and list notes (long tap)
  - add bookmark and list bookmarks (long tap)
  - activate the GPS log analyzer
  - activate the measure tool

* Right screen side

  - the context menu button
  - the zoom in and out buttons

* Lower center

  - battery status
  - center screen on GPS position and GPS status button
  - editing tools

=== Map navigation

The navigation of the map is probably the most basic and important part.

* **pan**: panning of the map, i.e. moving the map around is simply done
  by dragging the map with a finger. While panning, the current 
  longitude and latitude of the map center are displayed.
  
image::03_mapview/29_pan_coords.png[scaledwidth=30%, width=30%]

* **zoom**: zoom in and out can be done in different ways. There are 
  the zoom in/out buttons at the lower right part of the map. It is also
  possible to zoom in by double-tapping on the map. Zoom in and out can
  also be achived through https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-touch[pinch-zoom gestures].
  
NOTE: If you have trouble reading small text on some basemaps, you can "magnify" the map display by doing a long press on the "zoom in" button.  You can magnify multiple times if needed.  Don't forget to demagnify (long press on the "zoom out" button) before you do other Map View operations such as measure or feature ID.

* **center on GPS**: through the lower center button it is possible 
  to center the map on the GPS position. The button also shows the status of the GPS the same way as the icon <<action_bar,on the main view's action bar>>.

=== Add Notes

.The view from which notes are taken.
image::02_dashboard/03_notes.png[scaledwidth=30%, width=30%]

The add notes button opens the same notes view as the button on the dashboard. There is only once difference. Since notes can be added both in the GPS position and in the middle of the map, to open the add note view from the dashboard, the GPS is required to have a fix.

From the map view the user can open the add note view even without GPS signal, in which case notes will only be inserted at the map center position.

For further information about taking notes, visit the <<Notes, notes section>>.

=== The Notes List

A long press on the Notes icon will show the Notes List.  The notes list shows all the available notes, both text and image notes.

.The notes list view.
image::03_mapview/03_noteslist1.png[scaledwidth=30%, width=30%]

The icon on the right side of the actionbar allows the user to sort the notes by different modes:

* *None*: insertion order
* *By Name* and inverse: sorts the notes by their name
* *By Map center distance* and inverse: sorts the notes by the distance from the current map center position

.The notes sort order dialog.

In the upper part of the view there is a textbox that helps to filter out a particular note based on its name.

.Notes can be filtered by text.
image::03_mapview/04_noteslist_filter.png[scaledwidth=30%, width=30%]


At the right side of the list two icons are available. The left one positions the map on the selected note's position while the right one opens a menu:

.The note menu.
image::03_mapview/05_note_menu.png[scaledwidth=30%, width=30%]

From the note menu the user is able to:

* edit form based notes or view simple notes
* share the note through social networks
* delete the note
* use the current note as a filter. All notes with the same name will be visible.
* access the submenu related to all notes

.The submenu that considers all notes.
image::03_mapview/07_notes_all_menu.png[scaledwidth=30%, width=30%]

From the all-notes submenu the user can:
 
  - select all notes
  - invert the current selection
  - delete the selected notes

The pallet icon on the Notes List view allows you to change the graphic properties of the notes.

=== Add Bookmark

Bookmarks are in a layer on their own, that contains saved settings of the current map view.
When a bookmark is added, the user is prompted to insert a name for the bookmark
or leave the generated name based on the current time and date.

.The add bookmark dialog.
image::03_mapview/08_add_bookmark.png[scaledwidth=30%, width=30%]

When a bookmark is added, a small star is added on the map in the center of the screen.

Also the map bounds and zoom are saved. That way one can return to the scenario 
that the bookmark represents in any moment.

It is possible to tap on the bookmark to read its label.

.A tapped bookmark.

=== The Bookmarks List

The bookmarks list shows all the saved bookmarks.

In the upper part there is a textbox that helps to filter out a particular bookmark based on its name.

The user has 4 options, as the icons on each bookmark entry shows:

* go to the bookmark location (left icon)
* edit the bookmark
* delete the bookmark

.The list of bookmarks.

=== GPS log analysis tool

The log analysis tool allows to analyze the various positions of a GPS log.

Once enabled, you can simply touch (and hold) the screen near a GPS log and information about 
the nearest log point will be shown. Also the color of the text will be the one of 
the currently queried log:

=== Measure tool

Activating the measure tool disables the ability to pan the map while enabling the possibility to draw a path on the map and measure the path drawn. 

The *approximate* (the distance is calculated without considering elevation deltas and with the coordinate picking precision of a finger on a screen) distance is shown in the upper part of the map view.

When active, the measure tool has a orange colored icon, when inactive the icon is green instead.
